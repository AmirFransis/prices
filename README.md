What's in the Box
-----------------

The following binaries can be created using the code:

* `prices` - Downloads XMLs from all known vendors.
* `items` - Parses XMLs and generates SQL statements.

The following SQL scripts can be used:

* `pre.sql` - Generates the table schema. Should be executed prior to using
  the SQL generated by `items`.
* `post.sql` - Executes some counting and cleanup. Should be executed after
  building the database with `items`.

Requirements
------------

1. [Go](http://golang.org/) compiler added to your system path, to compile the
   go code.
2. [SQLite](http://sqlite.org/), to run the SQL generated by the Go programs.

How to Build
------------

1. Update GOPATH:
   * **Linux** - `export GOPATH=/path/to/project`
   * **Windows** - `set GOPATH=\path\to\project`
2. Compile everything. `cd` into project/src folder and execute:
   `go install ./...`
3. A `bin` folder will be created in the project's folder, containing all
   generated binaries.

TODOs
-----

Things to do in no particular order (in addition to TODOs in code).

* Create a table for manufacturers.
* Change binary names from `prices` and `items` to something more informative.
* Embed SQL scripts in `items` binary?
